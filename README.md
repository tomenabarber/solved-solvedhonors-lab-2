The ProblemA genetic algorithm consists of a population of individuals, where each individual is a bit string (i.e., a list of 0’s and 1’s) and an associated ﬁtness value indicating the goodness or badness of the individual. At the start of the genetic algorithm, each individual in the population is randomly initialized and the its ﬁtness assessed. Your Task 1. Create a population of 100 random individuals. Each individual should be a list of length 100 and a ﬂoat value that represents its ﬁtness. (Hint: Extend the code you wrote for part 1 that created one random individual.) 2. Evaluate the ﬁtness of all the individuals in your population using the counting ones ﬁtness function you wrote last week. Store the ﬁtness value with the individual. 1
